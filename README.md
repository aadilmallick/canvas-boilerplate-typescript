# Canvas boilerplate

Run `npx @2022amallick/canvas-boilerplate` to create a new project with canvas and typescript support.

This is a bun/npm compatible canvas boilerplate system. The boilerplate prompts should take care of everything.

If using npm, typescript's `tsc` is used to compile files. If using bun, bun build compiles files.
